Possible future new features (if somebody asks for it or I will need it myself):
* add the new types also to @integration:@ test phase - not sure if the tests run in that phase are thread safe
* run not only the test classes but also the tests within the test classes concurrently
* support for running other test types concurrently, i.e. Spock
